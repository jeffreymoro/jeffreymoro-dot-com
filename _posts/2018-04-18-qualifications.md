There comes a time in a doctoral student's life wherein they have to qualify to keep going on toward a dissertation. Usually it takes the form of an exam on a comprehensive list of materials. I find these lists useful and interesting not only for how they frame a field of inquiry for a person's diss, but also how they function as snapshots of what academia looked like for a particular student at a particular time. In assembling my list (my exam's in September), I found other folks' lists immensely helpful in thinking about scope, framing, and blind spots. [Maybe you'll find mine to be too.](https://notes.jeffreymoro.com/quals/)
