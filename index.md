# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

<img src="/assets/img/selfie-website-cropped.jpg" class="selfie"/>

I'm a PhD candidate in English with a certificate in Digital Studies at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://english.umd.edu). My [research](/research) is at the crossroads of digital media studies and the environmental humanities. I'm writing a dissertation titled "Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination," which explores [how we use computers to imagine the air as a computer](/blog/2020-02-24-what-its-about/). Some of my other research interests include: weather forecasting, speculative fiction, nuclear cultures, digital humanities, cybersecurity, media archaeology, biopolitics, and software emulation. My writing has appeared in [*Amodern*](https://amodern.net/author/jmoro/) and the [*Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/jeffrey-moro). 

Past lives: site manager for [Romantic Circles](https://romantic-circles.org/), post-baccalaureate resident for [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org), and degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu).

On this corner of the Internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), take a look at the [courses I teach](/teaching), or [read some blog posts](/blog). Though if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/assets/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I couldn't blame you.
