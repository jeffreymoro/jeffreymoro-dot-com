# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

<img src="/assets/img/selfie-website.jpg" class="selfie"/>

I'm a PhD candidate in English with a certificate in Digital Studies at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://english.umd.edu). My [research](/research) is at the crossroads of digital media studies and the environmental humanities. Some keywords include: media archaeology, infrastructure, computer security, speculation, affect and aesthetics, biopolitics, media materialism, weather forecasting, nuclear cultures. I'm writing a dissertation titled *Atmospheric Media*, which investigates geophysical and aesthetic atmospheres in digital media cultures. 

Past lives include: site manager for [Romantic Circles](https://romantic-circles.org/), post-baccalaureate resident for [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org), and degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu).

On this corner of the Internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), or [read some blog posts](/blog). Though if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/assets/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I couldn't blame you.
