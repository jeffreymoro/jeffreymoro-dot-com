# jeffreymoro [dot] com [FURTHER DEPRECATED]

This version of the site has been deprecated as I switched from jekyll to hugo. The updated version is [here](https://github.com/jeffreymoro/jeffreymoro-dot-hugo).

***

The code that powers my website / blog / lifestyle.

This repo lost a lot of its version history when I realized that I didn't need all the plugins that I thought I did (and GitHub Pages started supporting more of them) and then I moved it into a fresh repo (since I had been generating it locally and just committing the _site directory).
