## Description

"Digital studies" names a range of interdisciplinary approaches to the critical and creative study of digital media within the humanities and social sciences. This course is your introduction to this diverse and rapidly shifting field. Our overall goal is to develop a critical vocabulary for the analysis of digital objects and cultures, from computer code, to video games, to social media, to electronic waste, and more. To do so, we apply many of the traditional analytical tools of the humanities, particularly literary and media study, as well as creative practices of tinkering, making, and design. If the various interests and approaches under the rubric of "digital studies" have a shared method, it's that *doing things* is key to *knowing things*. In short: this course gives you the tools to understand how digital media operate in everyday life.

I've organized this version of the course around thirteen keywords in digital studies: digital, code, network, infrastructure, memory, physical, interface, social, manufacture, data, glitch, labor, and waste. Each week we'll dive into a specific keyword, although it's my hope that by the end of the semester we'll have mapped connections across them all. Loosely speaking, we begin with *definitional* questions, like "what is code?" and "how does the internet actually work?," before moving in the middle of the semester to questions of *interaction*, like "how do digital media connect us?" and "TKTKTKTK." In the last few weeks of the semester, we'll DO SOMETHING SPECIFIC ETC ETC ETC.

This is not a "learn to code" class; you don't need to know anything about computer science. When we do get our hands dirty, it will be in the service of experimentation and critical play. Your assignments will reflect this experimental approach as well. You'll do "traditional" academic writing, but also create objects, craft artist's statements, give presentations, and participate in regular "labs," during which you'll work hands-on with digital media technologies.

## Aims

## Materials

The vast majority of class readings are freely available on the internet or posted as PDFs to the course ELMS site. There are two books that you should plan to purchase:

- Ingrid Burrington, *Networks of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide to Urban Internet Infrastructure*. ISBN: 978-1-61219-542-1.
- J.R. Carpenter, *The Gathering Cloud*. ISBN: 978-1-910010-15-0

You should also have a working laptop running one of the following operating systems.

- Windows 10
- macOS 10.12 "Sierra" or any higher version
- Ubuntu 16.04 or higher (most major Linux repositories are acceptable)

Note that relying solely a tablet or Chromebook will make some in-class labs challenging. If you don't have a laptop available, I recommend [checking one out from McKeldin Library](https://www.lib.umd.edu/tlc/equipment). If none of these options suffice, please come speak with me before rushing out to buy an expensive laptop.

Here is also an incomplete list of the programs that you should plan to install over the course of this class. Note that you *should not pay for any of these programs*. Many do have options to pay but also have free demo modes that will suffice for our class. Not all are available for all platforms. I'll flag in class the ones that are most imperative for you to download.

- Firefox or Google Chrome (all platforms)
- Microsoft Word (Windows/macOS) or LibreOffice (Linux). Word is available for free through the [Terpware](https://terpware.umd.edu/) portal.
- Atom (all platforms)
- If on Windows, the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- Little Snitch (macOS only)
- Nestopia (all platforms)
- Cura (all platforms)
- Vinesauce ROM Corrupter (Windows)
- Sign up for Twitter. You don't need to post or participate in any way.

Should you choose to 3D print for the Object Lesson assignment, you may have to budget $10 to $15 for associated equipment costs.

## Assignments

Here's the overall breakdown:

- Participation: 10%
- Lab report #1: 10% [due before 3/15/18]
- Lab report #2: 10% [due before 4/26/18]
- Short Essay: 20% [due either on 3/8/2018 or 4/19/18; your choice]
- Object Lesson: 20% [same deadline scheme as the Short Essay]
- Lightning Talk: 5% [delivered the week of 5/6/18]
- Final Portfolio: 25% [due 5/17/18]

### A Note on Deadlines

As we're all coming to this class with different interests, backgrounds, and facilities; and as everyone's semester follows different rhythms of business and calm; and as I want you to take ownership over the work for this class, I have designed the assignments with flexible deadlines so that you can decide which assignments you want to tackle and when.

You will complete **two** Lab Reports throughout the semester, described below. You should turn the first Lab Report in anytime before Friday 15 March (i.e., the Friday before Spring Break), and the second anytime before Friday 26 April.

The two main assignments of the course are a Short Essay and an Object Lesson, also described below. You have the option of choosing which one you'd like to do first in the semester, to be due on Friday 8 March, and which you'd like to do second, to be due on Friday 19 April. **You will complete both assignments**—you won't do two Object Lessons and no Short Essay, for instance—but you choose the order.

Assignments are due at 11:59 PM the listed days. I'll reduce the grade on plus/minus grade level each day that it's turned in late (A becomes an A-; B- becomes a C+; and so forth). I won't accept assignments turned in more than a week late. If you have an extenuating circumstance that's making it difficult for you to reach a deadline, please write me, ideally well in advance, so we can discuss alternatives.

### Participation

The litmus test for participation is simple: do you come to class prepared and engaged? And when you contribute to the class in any medium, be it speech or text, do you do so in the spirit of collegiality, respect, and mutual betterment?

Note that "class participation" does not mean always raising your hand at opportune moments. Indeed, dominating a class conversation can be the precise opposite of effective and respectful participation. As such, I take a wide view of "participation" to include the thoughtfulness of your contributions to the class as a whole.

Attendance is crucial to your ability to participate in the class. Not only do we all need to be present in order to learn together, many if not all of the crucial concepts build off each other, meaning that missed classes compound on each other. Attending lab days are particularly crucial given their importance to your Lab Report assignments. Please see the PDF version of the syllabus for full UMD policies on course attendance.

### Lab Reports

*(with thanks to and modifications from [Jim Brown](http://courses.jamesjbrownjr.net/node/3510))*

Twice a semester you will submit a Lab Report drawn from your hands-on experience in one of our in-class labs. You will augment your in-class work with further outside exploration in the skill/tool/topic of your choice; for example, if you're writing a Lab Report about our experience in the BookLab in Tawes Hall, you should return to the BookLab to learn more about it and the skills we explored there. Or if you're writing a Report about video game emulation, you should continue to tinker with and explore different emulation platforms.
